## Beyond Speech-to-Text: Not transcription—composition, say it once and get the right text for every screen.
“Beyond Speech-to-Text” means we’re not trying to be a better dictation tool.
Traditional speech-to-text focuses on accuracy: turning what you said into written words.
We focus on composition: turning what you meant into the text that fits the place you’re typing.

A message for Slack, a prompt for ChatGPT, a GitHub issue, or a LINE reply all demand different tone, structure, and length.
This app reads the context of where you’re writing and helps your idea arrive as ready-to-paste text—polished, formatted, and appropriate for that screen.
